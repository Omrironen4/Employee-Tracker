# Employee-Tracker


## Welcome 

In this application I created an application that builds an Employee tracker. This application uses a MySQL database and is populated with data through a seed file along with the inquirer prompted questions and answers. This application is not live on a server, so please enjoy my walkthrough video. Thank you!
